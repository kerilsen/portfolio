            In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a
            stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it
            arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she
            remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture,
            in
            earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed
            them
            that it had been taken in his father’s lifetime.
            <br><br>
            There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original
            than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs.
            Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent
            servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people’s happiness were in his
            guardianship!--how much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of good or evil
            must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his
            character, and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon
            herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before;
            she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.
            <br><br>
            When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned downstairs, and,
            taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.
            <br><br>
            As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and
            aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it
            himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.
            <br><br>
            They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to
            avoid his sight. Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest
            blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering
            himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at
            least of perfect civility.
            <article>
                She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an
                embarrassment impossible to be overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
                they
                had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the
                gardener’s expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a
                little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her
                eyes
                to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at
                the
                alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her
                embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few
                minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life. Nor did he seem much
                more
                at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as to
                the
                time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a
                way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.
                <br><br>
                At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he
                suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.
                <br><br>
                The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and
                wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and
                vexation.
                Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange it must
                appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she
                had
                purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he thus come a day before
                he
                was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
                discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted from his horse or
                his
                carriage. She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so
                strikingly
                altered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such
                civility,
                to inquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had
                he
                spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast did it offer to his last
                address
                in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account for
                it.
