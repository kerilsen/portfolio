            <p>I have my Master's degree in Library and Information Studies and am currently taking a full stack flex
                coding bootcamp and will complete it in April 2024. I'm highly resourceful and a quick learner and I
                love rainy days and iced coffee. I can't wait to create new things and make the web prettier. Watch this
                space for real content coming soon!</p>
            <p>I have a particular interest in knowledge organization, the intersection of arts and computing, playing
                with code and thinking of different solutions to interesting problems.

            <h3>Education</h3>
            She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an
            embarrassment impossible to be overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
            they
            had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the
            gardener’s expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a
            little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her
            eyes
            to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family.
            <br><br>
            Amazed at
            the
            alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her
            embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few
            minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life. Nor did he seem much
            more
            at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as to
            the
            time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a
            way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.

            <h3>Work Experience</h3>

            At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he
            suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.
            <br><br>
            The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and
            wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and
            vexation.
            Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange it must
            appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she
            had
            purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he thus come a day before
            he
            was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
            discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted from his horse or
            his
            carriage. She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so
            strikingly
            altered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such
            civility,
            to inquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had
            he
            spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast did it offer to his last
            address
            in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account for
            it.
